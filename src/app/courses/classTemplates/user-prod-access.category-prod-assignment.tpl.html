        In this class, we will be creating the first of two final assignments necessary for a buyer user to gain access
        to a product. This assignment is called a 'Category Product Assignment', and creates the relationship between
        a product and a category. Remember, a product can never be assigned directly to a user. There must be a
        category in-between them to create the relationship. The next class will round out this relationship for
        the user.

        We will be focusing on the <code>create.js</code> script, but feel free to take a look at the others
        to see what kind of CRUD capabilities you have access to for Category Product Assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you are in the <code>create.js</code> script, take a look at the object you will be creating stored
        in the <code>assignment</code> variable. As you can see, it is a pretty simple object. It has a
        <code>CategoryID</code>, <code>ProductID</code>, and <code>ListOrder</code>. Additionally, a Category
        Product Assignment requires a <code>buyerID</code> as a parameter, represented by the first line of code.
        Fill in the <code>buyerID</code> for whatever buyer your selected user is a part of. Then
        fill in the <code>CategoryID</code> and <code>ProductID</code> with those you have been saving for
        this class.
    </p>

        When you are ready, go ahead and hit 'Run'!
