        If you followed the steps correctly, you have completed everything you need to do in order to
        accomplish the task of giving a buyer-user access to a product. Now is the final test to see if
        all the work you have done has been completed correctly. A few high-level concepts to remember
        as you move on. First, a product will only ever be availabe to a user if that product has a
        price schedule assigned to both that product and the user you are targeting. Second, a product
        can only be made accessible to a user through a category. There is absolutely no possible
        way to assign a user/userGroup/buyer directly to a product. It has to go through a category
        and category product assignment.

        After authenticating for the buyer-user you have been working with throughout this course, go
        ahead and run the script to the right. If it doesn't work, consider looking back to make sure
        that every object (product, user, category) that you were working with is active. If that doesn't
        work, consider trying again. If you have any further trouble, reach out to your Four51 contact
        to ask for help.
