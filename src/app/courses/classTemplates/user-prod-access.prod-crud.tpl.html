    <h3 class="page-title">What You Need To Know</h3>
    <p>
        In this course you will be walking through the necessary steps to make a product accessible to a buyer-user
        on your buyer side application. You will be working with three types of objects and 2 types of assignments,
        all of which are necessary for your buyer-user to gain access to a product.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the culmination of this course, you will get the chance to authenticate as a buyer-user and check
        if they have access to the product. If you follow closely, you won't have any trouble. Pay close
        attention to the <em>What You Need To Know</em> section, as we will explain some of the different rules and
        options you have when working with buyer-user product access beyond this course.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you get started, you will want to write down the userID of the user you plan on working with.
        This will help you keep track of things during this course, so you won't have to start over. If you
        do not have any users, step out of this course and create a user in one of two ways: Create a user
        in the <a ui-sref="base.console">API Console</a>, or, Take the
        <a ui-sref="base.course({courseid: 'basics'})">Basics</a> course, where we will help you create a
        basic environment, including your first user.

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating & Getting a Product</h3>
    <p>
        Looking over to the right, you can see that we have provided you with multiple scripts. While ultimate
        goal of this class is to set up a product OR get a product that you have already created, we also want
        to introduce you to the relevant CRUD operations you have access to. Take a look at the <code>update.js</code>,
        <code>patch.js</code>, and <code>delete.js</code> scripts and feel free to give them a try.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you are done playing around with these CRUD scripts, let's focus on the goal of this class. If you
        have a product in mind (and its ID), go into the <code>get.js</code> script. The Script is ready to
        run once you have filled in the <code>var productID</code> with the ID of the product you want to use.
        Make sure you take note of the ID that you are using, so you don't forget it in future classes!!! If
        this is your plan, go ahead and run it, and you are done!
    </p>
    <p>
        If instead you would like to create an entirely new product, we will focus on the <code>create.js</code>
        script. As you can see, there is an entire product object set inside the <code>var prod</code> variable.
        To create the new product, you only need to set the <code>ID</code>, <code>Description</code>,
        <code>Name</code>, <code>QuantityMultiplier</code>, and <code>Active</code> values. Everything else
        is up to you, but we recommend you focus on the fundamentals right now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Set the <code>ID</code>, <code>Description</code>, and <code>Name</code> to whatever you like. Set the
        <code>QuantityMultiplier</code> to 1 or more, and set <code>Active</code> to true. Note that in order
        for a buyer-user to access a product, in MUST be active.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that you have completed the configuration, review the code block. Note that the service
        call to create a Product is, <code>Products.Create(prod);</code>, where 'prod' is the new object you are
        creating, and the only parameter as part of the method call.
    </p>
    <p>
        On success, you will see in your console log the HTTP Request details. Click on the down button to see
        the JSON representation of the Request's response. In the response, you should see the same object you
        sent off in the request as your request object. Make sure you keep a note on the <code>ID</code> of the
        product you just created. Now Hit 'Run' when you are ready!
