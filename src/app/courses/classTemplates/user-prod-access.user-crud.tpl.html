    <p>
        The final piece (in no particular order) we need to create a 'product instance' is a user. Truthfully,
        we can select a user, a userGroup, or a buyer to accomplish this, but we will be using a user in this
        course to keep things simple, and to accomplish exactly what the name of this course suggests. If you
        completed the <em>Basics</em> course, you have already created a user. Feel free to use that user
        (if you remember the users <code>ID</code>), or create a new one, as we will help you do below.
    </p>

    <h3 class="page-title">Selecting your User</h3>
    <p>
        As in the previous classes, we have provided you with some of the standard CRUD operations inside of
        the various scripts to the right. Feel free to play around with those. As before, we will be focusing on
        the <code>create.js</code> and <code>get.js</code> scripts to accomplish what you need to get to the next
        class. If you have a user in mind that you would like to use, go ahead and select the <code>get.js</code>
        script, fill in the <code>userID</code> variable, and process the code-block. If you would like to create
        a new user, do so in the <code>create.js</code> script.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember that to create new user, all you need to fill in is the <code>ID</code>, <code>Username</code>,
        <code>Password</code>, <code>FirstName</code>, <code>LastName</code>, and <code>Active</code>. Set each
        of these to whatever you want, but make sure you set <code>Active</code> to true. You MUST set this value
        to true, or your user will not have access to any products. For the values that are not necessary (such as
        <code>Email</code> or <code>Phone</code>), make sure you take those key/values completely out of the user
        object (or they will get set to whatever the placehoder value is).
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure you take note of the ID that you are assigning to the user so you won't forget it. We will be
        using this shortly when we create our first assignment.

        When you are ready, hit 'Run'!
