        Before we create the final assignment, it is necessary that we select a category. A category is
        necessary for a user to gain access to a product because there is no direct connection between
        a user and a product. A user can only access a product through a category that has that product
        assigned to it. Additionally, a user has to be assigned to that category in order to gain access
        to the product. In other words, there are two category assignments necessary to create an indirect
        relationship between a user and product.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before we get into those assignments, let's select a category that you will use for this
        exercise.

        As usual, we have provided you with a few CRUD operational scripts outside of <code>create.js</code>
        and <code>get.js</code>. Play around as you see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a category and its respective <code>ID</code>, go ahead and take the necessary steps in the <code>get.js</code>
        script. Make certain the <code>Active</code> value is set to true if you are using an existing category.
        If you plan on creating a new one, step into the <code>create.js</code> script and follow along below.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may have learned how to create a category in the <em>Basics</em> course. As a refresher, when creating
        a new category you need to provide the <code>ID</code>, <code>Name</code>, <code>Description</code>, and
        <code>Active</code> values. The others you can choose to set, or take out from the object (don't leave them
        in there if you choose to leave them blank). Set the first three to whatever you please, and make sure you set
        <code>Active</code> to true. It MUST be true in order for a user to access the category.
    </p>

        When you are ready, go ahead and hit 'Run'!
