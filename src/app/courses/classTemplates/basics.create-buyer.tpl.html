        A Buyer in OrderCloud is an organization or set of related users that <em>submit orders</em> to
        a distributor (wholesaler, manufacturer, etc.) through an OrderCloud application, having a similar level
        of access and using a similar set of purchasing rules. A Buyer is one of the foundations of an OrderCloud
        application, because it often provides the <em>context</em> in which some other object is being defined
        (such as a user or category).
    </p>
    <p>
        Creating a Buyer is one of the more straightforward API Requests you will make in OrderCloud.
        In fact, you are only required to provide a name of your new buyer when creating one.
        If you choose to do this, your new buyer's <code>ID</code> will be auto-generated, and <code>Active</code> will
        be set to false. Creating a buyer uses the <em>Buyers</em> service provided from the SDK. The <em>Buyers</em>
        service, in turn, provides all the standard CRUD operations for dealing with Buyers.

        Below is a look at a full Buyer object. As you can see, it is very minimal,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 100px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Buyers.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Before we dive into the code itself note that over to the right, just above the code block,
        there are multiple tabs with different javascript verb-specified scripts. The tabs in {primary-tab-color} are tabs
        in which you will use to accomplish the primary goal of the specific class. The scripts in {secondary-tab-color}
        are there for you to become versed in the related CRUD operations that are available to you through
        the SDKs. In the case of this class, for example, you will only be required to successfully run the
        <code class="script">create.js</code> script. However, nearly all of these secondary scripts are
        <em>executable</em>, acting as a playground for you to run CRUD operations as you
        please. Primary and secondary scripts will be standard in the How-To Courses, as we want to
        help you accomplish a specific goal, but also introduce you to the broader functionality and concepts that are
        specific to the class topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now getting back to the topic at hand, creating a buyer. Over to the right in the
        <code class="script">create.js</code> script, there are two pieces we want to focus on to successfully
        create a new Buyer.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, on line 2 you can see a variable named <code class="var">buyer</code> that stores the object of
        the new buyer you will be creating. All you need to do is set the <code>ID</code> and <code>Name</code> to
        whatever you please, and change <code>Active</code> to true. Note that the ID must not include any spaces
        (non-alphanumeric is okay). Additionally, it is important that you set <code>Active</code> to true,
        or you will run into issues later when trying to access the catalogue as a buyer-user. If you accidentally
        set it to false, you can go over to the API console and update the buyer object to make it active.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second and final piece to create a new buyer is to make the SDK call to the OrderCloud API. This is
        a very simple SDK call, because it only requires one parameter--the buyer object. When you are ready,
        go ahead and run the script. We highly recommend that you make a note of your new buyer's ID so you
        can readily access and use it for future classes.
