        In this class, we will be creating the final assignments necessary for a buyer user to gain access
        to a product. This assignment is called a 'Category Assignment', and creates the relationship between
        a user and a category. This is the binding assignment for a user to get access to a product through a
        category. Without it, a product assigned to a category is meaningless, and with a product assigned
        to a category, this assignment is meaningless. Together, they create the relationship that makes
        everything possible.

        Similar to the Category Product Assignment, this is also a very simple object. In our case, we will
        only be using he <code>UserID</code> and <code>CategoryID</code>. The UserGroupID should be discarded.
        Note also that again we see a buyerID as a parameter. This parameter has some unique characteristics,
        in that if you decided to leave out BOTH <code>UserID</code> and <code>UserGroupID</code>, the
        category would be assigned to the buyer level. Keep this in mind for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, go ahead and set your <code>UserID</code> and <code>CategoryID</code> (and make sure
        to remove the <code>UserGroupID</code> value completely.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, go ahead and hit 'Run'!
