	<h3 class="page-header">What is it?</h3>
	<p>A <b>Software Development Kit (SDK)</b> is by definition a set of tools that allows the creation of applications for a certain development platform. This particular SDK is designed to simplify the use of the OrderCloud RESTful API within an AngularJS project. The SDK is an AngularJS module that contains a service for each API Resource. Each endpoint in an API Resource maps 1:1 to it's respective service's method in the SDK.</p>
	<p>OrderCloud's Angular SDK is auto-generated from the API source code so it will always be in sync with the latest release. The Seed comes with the OrderCloud AngularJS SDK pre-installed and ready for use as a Bower package.</p>
	<h3 class="page-header">How does it work?</h3>
	<p>AngularJS provides a service for interacting with RESTful server-side data sources, called <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource"><code>$resource</code></a>. This service is used by each method within the OrderCloud SDK to communicate with the OrderCloud API. This fact eliminates the need for OrderCloud developers to write their own <code>$resource</code> calls and makes API interaction a much more intuitive experience.</p>
	<p>Another feature of the SDK that will greatly simplify developers lives is the "Request" interceptor. Interceptors are the result of the Angular developers anticipating that it would be desirable to intercept http requests before they are handed to the server and responses before they are handed over to the application code that initiated these requests. And right they were! The Request Interceptor attempts to append headers for OAuth 2 authentication bearer tokens and request body content-types to each <code>$http</code> request.</p>
	<hr/>
	<h4 class="page-title">The Auth Service</h4>
	<p>The Auth service is one of the few pieces of the SDK that are not auto-generated because it has no API counterpart. It works in conjunction with the Request interceptor ngCookies to store authentication tokens for the duration of a users session. When a response hits the Request interceptor, if it has a property called "access_token" the Auth service is used to write the token to a cookie.</p>

		mode: 'javascript',
		tabSize: '4',
		useSoftTabs: true,
		showPrintMargin: false
	}" ng-model="class.current.ReadmeScripts[0]"></div>
	<br/>
	<p>Vice versa, when an outgoing request is intercepted it will return the previously stored access token to be appended to the headers of the request.</p>
	<div  readonly ui-ace="{
		onLoad: class.setMaxLines,
		useWrapMode : true,
		theme:'twilight',
		mode: 'javascript',
		tabSize: '4',
		useSoftTabs: true,
		showPrintMargin: false
	}" ng-model="class.current.ReadmeScripts[1]"></div>

	<h4 class="page-title">
		Constants and the Credentials service
	</h4>
	<p>The OrderCloud AngularJS SDK must be used in an Angular project that provides the following constants: <br/><small class="text-muted">(the OrderCloud Seed already contains placeholders for each of these)</small></p>

	<div  readonly ui-ace="{
		onLoad: class.setMaxLines,
		useWrapMode : true,
		theme:'twilight',
		mode: 'javascript',
		tabSize: '4',
		useSoftTabs: true,
		showPrintMargin: false
	}" ng-model="class.current.ReadmeScripts[2]"></div>
	<br/>
	<p>The Credentials service (also not a part of the API) has a <code>GET</code> method that takes in a parameter call "credentials" structured like this <code>{Username:'',Password:''}</code>. When requested, Credentials will use the previously mentioned constants to make a request to the Auth URL and return an <code>access_token</code>. As mentioned earlier, the Request interceptor will use the Auth service to store this token and append it to all subsequent request headers.</p>
	<p>When a developer wants to manually terminate a users access token cookie (log out), they can simply call <code>Credentials.Delete();</code> and the the SDK's Auth service will do the rest.</p>

	<!--TODO: I need help with Impersonation and Extending the SDK - I know how Impersonation works; however our code seems a little inconsistent and I'd like to write this correctly the first time.-->
<!--	<hr/>
	<h4 class="page-title">Impersonation</h4>
	<p>An OrderCloud developer need to, for whatever the reason, assume the role of another user in the system while maintaining their current authentication. Perhaps they want to see pricing for another user with different price schedule assignments and build an order on their behalf. This is what the As() method of every OrderCloud AngularJS SDK service is for. Using <code>Auth.SetImpersonationToken</code> developers can store an additional access token which will be used in place of the normally stored access token when a service method is prepended with .As().-->
