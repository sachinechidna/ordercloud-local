	<p>The term <b>"seed"</b> signifies this is the starting point for <b>all</b> OrderCloud applications created through the OrderCloud Development Center.  It was crafted using the most advanced web development tools and perfected over years of rapid development in the B2B world.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> <small>MVW Framework</small></h4>
			<p>The OrderCloud Seed runs on AngularJS, a powerful front-end tool created by Google, which provides an environment that is incredibly expressive, readable, and quick to develop.  It's extensible toolset can be leveraged in part or in whole alongside other libraries. Choosing AngularJS for our first Seed was an easy decision because it helped us provide our clients with the most flexible Front-End Framework and the fastest development workflow.</p>
			<p>It is highly recommended (if you haven't already) that you familiarize yourself with <a href="https://code.angularjs.org/1.4.5/docs/guide/introduction" target="_blank" tooltip="Angular Developer Guide (v1.4.5)">Angular</a> and it's concepts. We will cover some of the features that pertain to the <b>OrderCloud AngularJS SDK (Software Development Kit)</b> in the next class; however, learning everything about Angular requires education beyond the scope of these courses.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">Node Package Manager (NPM)</a> <small>Installation of Build tools.</small></h4>
			<p>NPM is used by the OrderCloud seed to install all of the necessary packages for Building and Compiling your application source code.  In the unlikely scenario a developer wants to alter or add to the Ordercloud Build - they will use NPM to install a new package and when done correctly (saving the install to your package.json), the Dev Center will alter it's Build process as well.</p>
			<p>When a developer first opens an OrderCloud Seed, running <code>$npm install</code> is the first step toward development.</p>

For web development it can help by doing CSS preprocessing, JS transpiling, minification, live reloading, and much more. Integrations are built into all major IDEs.</p>
			<p>In the Seed, Gulp additionally takes care of cross-browser CSS, Angular Injection patterns, and even improves performance by compiling all project HTML files into one JS file that stores them in the templateCache.</p>

			<p>AngularUI Router is a routing framework for AngularJS, which allows you to organize the
				parts of your interface into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank"><em>state machine</em></a>. Unlike the
				<a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute.$route" target="_blank"><code>$route</code> service</a> in the Angular ngRoute module, which is organized around URL
				routes, UI-Router is organized around <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki" target="_blank"><em>states</em></a>,
				which may optionally have routes, as well as other behavior, attached.</p>
			<p>States are bound to named, nested and parallel views, allowing you to powerfully manage your application's interface.</p>
