    <p>
        Now for the final step of creating and using a group, assigning users to the user group. The typical
        first steps towards accessing any object as a buyer-user is to create the necessary objects
        and then assign them as necessary. This is the first of many create and assign combinations you will be executing.
        In fact, you will be creating three more objects and completing three more assignments in this course alone!
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason for all of these assignments outside of the object creations themselves is to fit the profile
        of the modular nature of OrderCloud. It may seem like it is creating more steps for you to have to create
        and assign separately, but there is a reason for it. We want you to use exactly what you need to build an
        application for yourself or your clients, and nothing more. If we started creating nested objects directly inside
        of other objects (such as products inside of a category or prices inside of a product), it
        would require you to use more than you really need, thus slowing down the development time
        and vastly reducing your ability to define a proper project scope (this is the crux of a SAAS application;
        You have to use the whole package they offer). And as an added plus, you will find to love the modular
        orientation of OrderCloud once you get comfortable with it, because the separation of concerns makes it easier
        to manage and intuitively understand the structure of your environment.

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a Group Assignment</h3>
    <p>
        A full group assignment object is shown below,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 85px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.UserGroups.SaveMemberAssignment.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Taking a look at the <code class="script">create.js</code> script, you can see what is required to
        create a new Group assignment. Go ahead and replace the <code class="var">buyerID</code> variable with
        the new buyer you created earlier in this course. In the <code class="var">assignment</code> variable,
        a sample request object is currently stored with 3 values--<code>UserGroupID</code>, <code>UserID</code>,
        and <code>BuyerID</code>. Start by taking out the <code>BuyerID</code> object, as we won't need that (and
        it is already assumed in the parameter object).
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be assigning two of your three new users to this group. You have two options to accomplish this.
        First you can process the <code class="script">create.js</code> script twice with each of the users you
        are assigning. The second and more challenging option is to create a second assignment object (with a different
        variable name, of course) and process and second SDK call in the same script with that second assignment object.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are ready, go ahead and process the request by hitting "Run".
