	<p><b>Representational State Transfer (REST)</b> is an increasingly popular software architecture that enables scalable, maintainable, and performant web services. An API exposes underlying data models the same way your browser makes a request to a server to receive a web page, through the HTTP protocol.</p>
	<p>RESTful APIs allow client interaction via standard data objects and markup (i.e. XML, JSON, HTML); which is conceptually different than the representation of the data stored on the server. This means developers don't have to worry about dealing with conversions or advanced data manipulation to send and receive information, letting them focus on building a great front-end.</p>
	<h3 class="page-header">What makes an API <em>"RESTful"</em>?</h3>
	<p>For an entity to classify as RESTful it must satisfy the following constraints:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Client-Server Separation</dt>
		<dd>This means the client is never concerned with data storage, similarly as the server is never concerned with the user-interface.</dd>
		<dt>Stateless</dt>
		<dd>The server never concerns itself with the state of the client; each request contains all the information needed to service the request.</dd>
		<dt>Cacheable</dt>
		<dd>A RESTful API will in some way state that it is cacheable or not, ensuring that data isn't stale or misused in your application</dd>
		<dt>Layered System</dt>
		<dd>A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way.</dd>
		<dt>Code on Demand</dt>
		<dd>Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by the transfer of executable code.</dd>
		<dt>Uniform Interface</dt>
		<dd>Ensures that the API will not fundamentally change it's architecture and developers can have confidence that an update won't break their applications.</dd>

		Making Requests <br/>
		<small>Each request has a few key components that are required to be successfully serviced.</small>
	</h3>

	<h4>HTTP Method</h4>
	<p>Defining a request <b>method</b> tells the server what kind of action the client is attempting to make. With the right access, clients can Create, Retrieve, Update, or Delete server-side data (commonly referred to as CRUD operations) using the methods described below.</p>

	<table class="table table-bordered">
		<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Opteration</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code>GET</code></td>
			<td>Retrieve</td>
			<td>One of the most commonly used methods; allows you to do exactly as the name	suggests. <code>GET</code> is what you will use to access any data objects that are already stored on the server. This method is read-only, meaning you will only be able to access information stored on the server, not manipulate it.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>POST</code></td>
			<td>Create</td>
			<td><p>Also a very commonly used Method in OrderCloud 3.0; allows you to send new objects to be created and stored on the server. With a <code>POST</code> Method call, you must also send an object as part of the request, called the "request body". The format of the request body will vary; however, in the context of OrderCloud the format is application/JSON in all cases but one.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>PUT</code></td>
			<td>Create or Update</td>
			<td><p>A utility method in RESTful API's. It allows you to create OR update an object stored on	the server. With a <code>PUT</code> method call, you must also send an object in the request. If the ID of the object is not found on the server, a new object will be created with that ID. If the ID of the object is found, a <code>PUT</code> method will update the object with the new object you send in the request. Note that if you are using <code>PUT</code> to update a pre-existing object, you must send a full object in your request. This means you cannot send it an object with only the updates you wish to make.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>PATCH</code></td>
			<td>Partial Update</td>
			<td><p>Similar to a <code>PUT</code> in that it updates a pre-existing object already stored on the server. The difference is that with a <code>PATCH</code> method call, you only have to send the changes in the request object vs. the entire object. This works great for when you are only updating a small piece of the object you are targeting.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>DELETE</code></td>
			<td>Delete</td>
			<td><p>This will remove an entire object from server. You will not have to send an object with a <code>DELETE</code> method call, as the information of the target object you are attempting to delete will be in the parameters.</p></td>
		</tr>
		</tbody>

	<h4>Request URL</h4>
	<p>The Request URL defines which API the client wishes to communicate with. The base URL is the part of the Request URL that identifies the location of the server the client is attempting to contact (this remains constant throughout a single API). The Routing URL informs the server what data the client is targeting, so the server knows where to perform the defined method.</p>
	<hr/>

	<h4>HTTP Headers</h4>
	<p>Headers are synonymous with 'Meta Information',	meaning they provide additional, descriptive (but necessary) information about the request. One typical use case of HTTP headers is sending <b>authorization</b> or <b>bearer</b> "tokens" for APIs with security measures. Another common header is the "Content-Type" which defines the format of the each request's body (if present) and response.</p>
	<hr/>

	<h4>Parameters</h4>
	<p>Parameters are not necessarily a part of every request, because not every request requires a parameter. Parameters can be included in a request in two ways: in the routing URL or as query strings. Route parameters are denoted in most API documentation using a single bracket <code>{}</code> notation within the Routing URL.  Query string parameters exist at the end of the Routing URL starting with <code>/?</code> each split up by <code>&</code>, using a key/value format of <code>key=value</code>.</p>
	<hr/>

	<h4>Request Body</h4>
	<p>The final component is the request body. A request body, much like params, is required in some calls, while unnecessary in others. A Request Body is needed when when creating or updating an object on the server, while the exact opposite is true when retrieving or deleting an object.  The format of the Request Body is defined within the "Content-Type" header and will match the response (when present).</p>
