    <p>
        One of the challenges you will encounter while working with OrderCloud is understanding the
        context in which the new objects you create are defined. Specific rules like being able
        to use a product across multiple buyers, but not being able to use a category across multiple
        buyers, or understanding the assignments required to give a user access to a specific product
        are all advanced topics, but end up being the backbone of what makes OrderCloud such a powerful
        platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first example of this defined "context" is within a user object. A user object must be
        defined under the context of a buyer. In other words, one user object must be <em>under</em> one
        and only one buyer. This specific rule is pretty logical and straight forward, so it provides a good
        starting point for developing your understanding of these context rules. We will explain these
        contexts as we move through the each course, and eventually you will be an expert!

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a New User</h3>
    <p>
        A full user object has more stored values than what you saw in the buyer object,
        as you can see below,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 200px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Users.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Take a look at the code block we have provided you to the right. You will see across the top all of
        the CRUD operation scripts, but for now we will be focusing on creating a new user in the
        <code class="script">create.js</code> script. As you can see inside of <code class="script">create.js</code>,
        you have a full user object like the one above stored in a variable called <code class="var">var user</code>.
        There are three important pieces to this script that will eventually be used together to create your first user.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you have <code class="var">var buyerID</code>, which is the variable in which you will store the
        ID of the buyer you will be using as the <em>context</em> for this user. Go ahead and replace
        <code class="string">"{buyerID}"</code> with the ID of the buyer you created in the previous class.
        Make sure you store this value as a string or you will run into an error processing the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, you have <code class="var">var user</code>, which is the variable storing the new user object
        you will be creating. Go ahead and fill out everything from <code>ID</code> to <code>Phone</code> with
        whatever you like. Note that it is important that your ID, Username, and Password do not have any spaces
        (non-alphanumeric values are ok), and the Email be in the format of a standard email address. Once you
        are done with this, leave <code>TermsAccepted</code> and <code>xp</code> to null. Finally, set
        <code>Active</code> to true. It is important that you set this to active or you will not be able to gain
        access to the products, categories, and other objects you should be able to when authenticating as one
        of these users (you can of course always update a user who is inactive to make them active).
    </p>
    <p>
        And finally, on line 18 of the code block in <code class="script">create.js</code>, we have the SDK
        call to create the User. This SDK Service Method takes two parameters, the <code class="var">buyerID</code>
        and <code class="var">user</code> variables, in that order.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend you write down each of the new users <code>ID</code>, <code>Username</code>, and <code>Password</code>
        somewhere so you can refer to them in later classes. Remember to read through the response console
        to work through any errors if you run into any trouble!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are ready, go ahead and process the request by hitting "Run". You will need to create 3 new users
        before you continue to the next course.
