    <p>
        Now that you have created a buyer, a user, and generated a successful API
        Access Claim giving your buyer-users the ability to authenticate on the client-site, you are ready
        to sign in as a buyer-user and truly begin your journey in OrderCloud. The goal if this page is
        for you to get the current authenticated users basic information. This is possible through the use
        of the 'Me' service, which will be one of your most powerful tools when building the buyer-site.
    </p>
    <p>
        To
        get to the point where you can use the 'Me' service, you first need to set your clientID to
        the ID in the Access Claim you just created a moment ago. To do so, you will need to open the context
        selection form in the bottom right corner (<i class="fa fa-user"></i> icon), and fill out the form
        with your new clientID, along with your new buyer-users username and password.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have successfully authenticated as this user, you are ready to run your first <em>Me</em>
        service request. You do not have to add anything yourself, as the <em>Me</em> service is meant to
        be a very easy and straightforward way of getting a users information and objects they have access to
        (products, categories, addresses, etc.).

        When you are ready, go ahead and hit 'Run'!
