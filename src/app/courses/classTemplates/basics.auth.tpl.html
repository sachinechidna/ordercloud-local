    <p>
        Authentication is a standard part of every API call you and your users make through OrderCloud.
        In fact, it is impossible to access anything inside of OrderCloud without being authenticated. OrderCloud
        handles authentication through the use of tokens that get sent in each API request header. The good news
        is that the Angular SDK provides a service that makes dealing with Authentication a seamless experience for
        Developers. This service is called 'Credentials' and allows you to get, set, and deleete your authentication token,
        which is saved inside the browsers cookies to be accessed for all subsequent OrderCloud API calls. It's truly
        a "set it and forget it" service!
    </p>
    <p>
        There is one more thing you should know about Authentication and the 'Credentials' service. When requesting
        authorization through 'Credentials', the service will go looking around for an app constant named, 'clientid'
        (stored in app.js). This 'clientid' will be sent along with the request to let the server know what
        distributor/buyer it should be looking under, and what level of access it should give the user
        you are trying to authenticate. You won't be sending this inside the request object yourself, but just
        know that it will be a part of the request and is integral to being successfully authenticated.

        On the right, we have setup a short script for you to authenticate your distributor user. All you need
        to do is enter your 'Username' and 'Password' in their respective locations. The
        <code>Credentials.Get(creds);</code> function call will take care of everything else for you, including sending the
        request to get your access token, and storing the token in your browser cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you have filled in your Username and Password, go ahead and click 'Run'. If you get an error, make
        sure that you are using the credentials of a Distributor User and not a Buyer User.
