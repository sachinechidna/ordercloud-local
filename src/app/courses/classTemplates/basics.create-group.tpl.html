    <p>
        Creating a group is an easy and powerful way to give a subset of users the same access to a
        set of products, categories, pricing, permissions, and many other configurations that apply
        to a collection of users. They are easy to create and maintain, but most importantly, they are
        flexible. They manage to be flexible in two major ways. First, a user can be assigned to any amount
        of groups, whether that be 0, 1, or many. This means one user can have a combination of permissions
        from a mix of whatever groups they are assigned to. If group 1 has access to category A, and
        group 2 has access to category B, a user assigned to both gains access to both category A and B.
        Second, a group is given similar behaviors as a user. This means a group can be used in place of
        a user for nearly every assignment (category assignment, product assignment, address assignment,
        etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        What this flexibility means is that you can more easily create and scale an application with a
        massive or growing user base without sacrificing functionality due to administration getting out
        of hand. We urge you to create and use groups as often as you can, as it will help decrease
        the time it creates to build an administrative application, make it easier for the admin users
        to manage users, and even make it easier to allow buyer-users to self-administer.

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a New User</h3>
    <p>
        A full user object has more stored values than what you saw in the buyer object,
        as you can see below,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 120px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.UserGroups.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Take a look at the code block we have provided you to the right. You will see across the top all of
        the CRUD operation scripts, but for now we will be focusing on creating a new user in the
        <code class="script">create.js</code> script. As you can see inside of <code class="script">create.js</code>,
        you have a full group object like the one above stored in a variable called <code class="var">var group</code>.
        Much like when creating your first set of users, creating a group has an identical number and type of
        parameters. Because of this, I will focus on the new user object and skim through the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's focus again on the <code class="script">create.js</code> script for this class.
        As with creating a new user, creating a new group requires that you include an ID of the buyer you plan on
        using as the context. Set this the same as you did in the <em>Create a User</em> course in the
        <code class="var">buyerID</code> variable. Now move your focus down to line 4 where <code class="var">group</code>
        is set with the new group object. Go ahead and fill out the <code>ID</code>, <code>Name</code>, and
        <code>Description</code> values as you would like. Note again that <code>ID</code> must not have any spaces.
        Leave <code>ReportingGroup</code> set to false and <code>xp</code> set to null. Do not worry about what either
        of these are right now, as it is outside of the scope of this course.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend you write down the ID of your new group. You will end up using it in the next class.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are ready, go ahead and process the request by hitting "Run". You only need to create one new group
        before you continue to the next course.
