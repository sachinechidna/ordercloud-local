    <p>
        API Access Claims are an important administrative service in OrderCloud.
        This service is where you will explicitly create each buyer application instance and
        where you will define the scope of each application's access rights. Without this you would
        not be able to authenticate as a buyer user, which would prove troubling within your buyer
        applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        When processing a successful API Access Claim, an ID will be returned to you that will act as your applications
        <code>clientID</code>. For this class, we recommend that you let the <code>ID</code> auto-generate for this.
        This is what you will store in the base of your application as an app constant
        named <code>clientid</code>. This clientID is what the client application will use to tell OrderCloud
        what buyer environment it should be looking under when a user attempts to authenticate on the site.

    <p>
        A full API Access Request Object is shown below. We will only be using part of this object, as the
        <code>ClientSecret</code> is not necessary for this exercise (we'll be using the administrative token stored
        in your browsers cookies for your current admin user), and <code>DefaultUserContextID</code> is an
        advanced topic we won't be touching on right now.
    </p>
    <div style="height: 200px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.ApiClients.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Review the documentation if you'd like a further review of each of these values. For now, we'll make
        a standard access claim and use that moving forward. First, go ahead and take out the <code>ID</code>
        and <code>ClientSecret</code> from the <code>var claim</code> object. We will let the <code>ID</code>
        auto-gen, and the <code>ClientSecret</code> is unnecessary for now. Set the <code>AccessTokenDuration</code>
        and <code>RefreshTokenDuration</code> to whatever you would like (keep in mind this is in milliseconds).
        Set the <code>AppName</code> as you please, and leave the <code>Claims</code> array as it is. Take out the
        <code>DefaultUserContextID</code>, and your <code>var claim</code> object is ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, before you run the code block, you will need to set your <code>var buyerID</code> to the ID of the
        buyer you created in the <em>Create a Buyer</em> class. Also, please keep a note of the ID that is returned
        when you create this access claim, as you will be using it in the following class.
