    <p>
        Creating a Price Schedule is the next step in giving a buyer-user access to a product, as this
        is the ONLY way what we call a 'derived product variant' can be created along with the proper
        product assignment (which you will learn about in the next class). A 'derived product variant'
        is in essence how the OrderCloud data-model defines an instance of a product in a buyer-application.
        In other words, a product doesn't technically exist from the perspective of a buyer-application unless
        a 'derived product variant' exists. This may seem a bit confusing at first, but the best way to look at
        it is that a product object itself (that you created or accessed in the previous class) is a
        <em>prototype</em> of the product, and the 'derived product variant' is an <em>instance</em> of it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="page-title">Defining your Price Schedule</h3>
    <p>
        Similar to the previous class where you created or accessed a product, we have provided you with a few
        additional scripts beyond the <code>create.js</code> and <code>get.js</code> scripts to allow you to
        play around with the CRUD operations for Price Schedules. Feel free to use any of these as you feel
        necessary, and move on to the instructions below when you are done.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you already have a defined price schedule that you would like to use in this class, feel free to follow
        the same steps as in the last course to retrieve your price schedule with its <code>ID</code>. If you
        are creating a new price schedule, make sure you are on the <code>create.js</code> script.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see, the price schedule object has some more depth than the product object. You can learn more
        about what each of these values mean in the documentation, but for now we will focus on the fundamentals
        for creating a price schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will be focusing on the <code>ID</code>, <code>Name</code> values, and the <code>PriceBreaks</code> array.
        Set the <code>ID</code> and <code>Name</code> to whatever you choose. In the <code>PriceBreaks</code> array,
        you will need to define at least one set of price breaks. For now, we will keep it simple and define and
        create a standard price break for a product with one price regardless of quantity. Leave the
        <code>Quantity</code> value at 0 and set the <code>Price</code> to anything you want. Note that setting
        <code>Quantity</code> to 0 is simply telling the system that for any quantity above 0, set the price to
        whatever you set the price to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once again, after you run this script, make sure you take note of the <code>ID</code>, or you might have to come
        back and do it again if you forget it!
    </p>

        When are ready, hit 'Run'!
