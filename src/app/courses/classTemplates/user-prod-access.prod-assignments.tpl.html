        Now that you have a product, price schedule, and user defined and ready to work with, let's complete
        the final step to make your first 'product instance'. The goal of the last three classes was to make
        sure you had the necessary pieces to make a product assignment that creates a relationship between the
        three, and ultimately create a 'product instance'. After this class, we will make the final steps towards making
        a product visible to a buyer-user by creating a category and creating a category assignment.

        There are 3 scripts to the right. The last two are primarily for viewing purposes, but like the others before
        it, they can be processed if you are interested in playing around with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's focus on the task at hand. Make sure you are on the <code>create.js</code> script before you continue.
        As you can see in the <code>assignment</code> variable, There are 6 different values. We will only be using
        3 of the 6 to create the assignment. To learn more about each of these values, review the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start by removing the values we don't need. Remove <code>ReplenishmentPriceScheduleID</code>,
        <code>UserGroupID</code>, and <code>BuyerID</code>. Now that you have the three values you need,
        go ahead and fill them out with the ID's for each of these. If you forgot the ID's of any of these,
        go back to the necessary class to recreate one.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, go ahead and hit 'Run'!
